# Health Violations 101

Take for example health violations. Health violations are common, with [1 in 10

Violations range from bacterial contamination to chemical safety breaches, and 
can indicate a potentially failing system because they directly correlate with 
public health risks that undermine safe drinking water delivery. However, data 
on health violations is dependent on various factors, including enforcement 
rates, regulatory frameworks, reporting consistency, and real-world water 
system issues. To understand more, we will examine the growth of health-based 
violations in Texas from the period 1975-2024.

In this graph, are we actually witnessing an increase in water quality 
violations? Or a decline in water quality? The reality on the ground may be 
more nuanced:
