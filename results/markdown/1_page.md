# Health-Based Drinking Water Violations 101

For example, let us look at health-based drinking water violations. 
Health-based violations are fairly common, with national data showing 
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace2d9#erlace2d9s2" target="_blank"> 
1 in 10 Americans drinking water from a system that experienced health-based 
violations during the three-year period of 2018 to 2020 </a>.
Violations range from bacterial contamination to chemical safety breaches, and 
can, depending on the persistence and scope of the violations, be an indicator 
of a potentially failing system because they directly correlate with 
public health risks that undermine safe drinking water delivery. However, data 
on health violations is dependent on various factors, including enforcement 
rates, regulatory frameworks, reporting consistency, and real-world water 
system issues. To understand more, let us examine the growth of health-based 
violations in Texas from 1978 - 2024.

In this graph, the data says there is no doubt we are seeing more violations. 
But what does that mean? Are we actually witnessing a decline in water quality 
delivered to customers? The reality on the ground may be more nuanced.
