# Changes in Health-Based Drinking Water Violations: 1990 - 1994 

For example, the Total Coliform Rule 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule" target="_blank"> (TCR) </a>
implemented in 1990, created a new 
framework for water quality monitoring that changed how violations were tracked 
and reported. What initially appeared as an increase in water quality problems 
may be largely due to more rigorous testing requirements and improved detection 
methods, rather than a sudden decline in water quality. The subsequent drop in 
TCR violations indicates that systems were responsive to the increased 
monitoring requirements, resulting in improved water quality from a TCR 
perspective.
