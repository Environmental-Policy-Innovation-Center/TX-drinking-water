# Violations & Water Quality 

But are we actually seeing an increase in violations related to sudden declines 
in water quality? Or how violations were categorized? For example, The Total 
Coliform Rule [TCR](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule), 
implemented in 1990, created a new framework for water quality monitoring that 
changed how violations were tracked and reported. What initially appeared as an 
increase in violations was largely due to more rigorous testing requirements and 
improved detection methods, rather than a sudden decline in water quality.
