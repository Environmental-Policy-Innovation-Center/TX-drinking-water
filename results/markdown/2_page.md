# Violations & Water Quality 

For example, The Total 
Coliform Rule [TCR](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule), 
implemented in 1990, created a new framework for water quality monitoring that 
changed how violations were tracked and reported. What initially appeared as an 
increase in violations may be largely due to more rigorous testing requirements 
and improved detection methods, rather than a sudden decline in water quality.
