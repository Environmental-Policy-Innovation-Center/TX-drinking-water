# Changes in Health-Based Violations 2015 - 2020

As the drinking water world learned more about the impact of coliform bacteria,
the Revised Total Coliform Rule went into effect in 2016, resulting in a response 
from water systems and a corresponding reduction in Total Coliform violations in 
years following implementation of the Rule. 

This analysis underscores both the power and limitations of examining complex 
questions through a purely quantitative lens. As veteran technical assistance 
providers reminded us during our investigation, boil water notices are NOT 
inherently an indicator of system failure. These notices often represent 
proactive public safety measures rather than systemic breakdown. 

Similarly, water quality violations, like those involving PFAS or fluoride, 
may hint at underlying issues, but their true significance depends on 
additional factors like the level and persistence of the violation, and how the 
system responds. For example, a violation for exceeding the 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations" target="_blank"> MCL or Maximum Contaminant Level </a>
of a rule might be a one-off event; however frequent 
exceedances, across multiple rules, can indicate a concerning systemic issue.
