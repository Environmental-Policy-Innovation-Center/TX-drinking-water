# Decline in Violations?

The implementation of the Revised Total Coliform Rule in 2016 corresponded with a reduction in Total Coliform violations. This period also saw the enforcement of the [Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/stage-1-and-stage-2-disinfectants-and-disinfection-byproducts-rules), which led to a decline in Stage 1 violations.

This analysis underscores both the power and limitations of examining complex questions through a purely quantitative lens. As veteran technical assistance providers reminded us during our investigation, 'Boil water notices are NOT inherently an indicator of system failure. These notices often represent proactive public safety measures rather than systemic breakdown.' Similarly, water quality violations, like those involving PFAS or fluoride, may hint at underlying issues, but their true significance depends on the level and persistence of the violation.
