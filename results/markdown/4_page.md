# Decline in Violations?

The implementation of the Revised Total Coliform Rule in 2016, however, 
corresponded with a reduction in Total Coliform violations. This period also 
saw the enforcement of the [Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts 
Rule](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/stage-1-and-stage-2-disinfectants-and-disinfection-byproducts-rules), 
which led to a decline in Stage 1 violations.

This analysis underscores both the power and limitations of examining complex 
questions through a purely quantitative lens. As veteran technical assistance 
providers reminded us during our investigation, boil water notices are NOT
inherently an indicator of system failure. These notices often represent 
proactive public safety measures rather than systemic breakdown.


Similarly, water quality violations, like those involving PFAS or fluoride, 
may hint at underlying issues, but their true significance depends on additional
factors like the level and persistence of the violation, and how they are 
addressed. For example, a violation for exceeding the [MCL or 
Maximum Contaminant Level](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations) 
for a single rule might be a one-off event, however frequent exceedances, 
across multiple rules, can indicate a systemic issue.
